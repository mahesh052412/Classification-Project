# Classification-Project
# Diabetes Risk Prediction
## Objective
The objective of this project is to propose different classification machine learning models to classify a patient as having the risk of developing diabetes or not. Diagnosing a patient for diabetes depends on several factors like lifestyle habits, medical history, family history, and many more that help make accurate predictions.

## Problem Statement
The problem we are trying to solve is a binary outcome for which we need to use supervised classification algorithms that would learn from past medical data and help predict the result for new patients.

## Classification Algorithms
The proposed classification algorithms to use are:

- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation Metrics

## To assess the performance of the machine learning models used, we will consider some of the best-known evaluation metrics to see how well the modelâ€™s prediction was based on the training data:

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision
- F1-Score
- Log Loss/Binary Cross-Entropy
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Necessary Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
